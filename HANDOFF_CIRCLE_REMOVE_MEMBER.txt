# HANDOFF: Host-Only "Remove Member" Control

## Summary
Added a host-only control to remove members from a Circle in the Members Sheet Modal.

## Changes Made

### File: src/app/circle/[id].tsx

1. **Added icon imports** (lines ~24-34):
   - Added `Trash2` and `AlertCircle` to the icon imports from `@/ui/icons`

2. **Added removeMemberMutation** (~lines 804-832):
   - Calls `DELETE /api/circles/${id}/members/${memberUserId}`
   - On success: Shows success toast, clears selection, invalidates queries
   - On error: Shows appropriate error toast (403 for non-host, 400 for host removal attempt)

3. **Added Remove Member Confirmation Modal** (~lines 1917-1998):
   - Shows when `selectedMemberToRemove` state is set
   - Displays warning icon and member name
   - Cancel and Remove buttons with loading state
   - Uses existing design patterns (FadeIn animation, colors from theme)

4. **Added Remove button in Members Sheet** (~lines 1817-1835):
   - Only visible when `isHost && !isHostOfCircle` (current user is host AND member is not the host)
   - Trash icon button with red tint
   - Triggers confirmation modal on tap
   - Uses `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent navigation to user profile

## State Already Existed
- `selectedMemberToRemove` state was already declared at line ~709 (unused until now)

## API Contract
The implementation expects:
```
DELETE /api/circles/:circleId/members/:userId
- 200: Success (member removed)
- 400: Cannot remove host
- 403: Only host can remove members
- 404: Member not found
```

## UI Behavior
1. Host opens Circle > Settings > Members
2. Host sees trash icon on each member (except themselves with "Host" badge)
3. Host taps trash icon
4. Confirmation modal appears with member name
5. Host confirms removal
6. Member is removed, success toast shown
7. Circle member list updates automatically

## NOT CHANGED
- Leave Circle functionality for non-hosts (works via swipe in Friends tab)
- The existing "Leave Group" option in Group Settings (shows toast directing to Friends tab)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Host can see remove button on non-host members
- [ ] Host cannot see remove button on themselves
- [ ] Non-host cannot see any remove buttons
- [ ] Confirmation modal shows correct member name
- [ ] Cancel button dismisses modal without action
- [ ] Remove button calls API and shows success toast
- [ ] Member list updates after removal
- [ ] API errors show appropriate error messages

## TypeScript Status
✅ No TypeScript errors in circle/[id].tsx
(Pre-existing unrelated errors in account-center.tsx and EmailVerificationBanner.tsx)
