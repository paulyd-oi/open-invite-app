CLAUDE OPUS — OPEN INVITE STABILIZATION TEMPLATE (SSOT)

MODEL REQUIREMENT:
Use Claude Opus.

READ FIRST (MANDATORY):

docs/GOLDEN_FLOWS.md

docs/UX_CONTRACTS.md

docs/INVARIANTS.md (if present)

docs/STATE_OF_THE_APP.md (if present)

docs/FINDINGS_LOG.md (if present)

ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

ONE ISSUE PER TASK. Fix ONLY the issue described under “TASK”.

Outcome-first: success is defined by ACCEPTANCE CHECKS passing in the actual UI.

Do not claim success by code inspection alone.

Must do a blast-radius sweep: search for other occurrences of the same pattern and either fix them or explicitly justify why not.

Minimal diff. No new dependencies. Preserve navigation architecture.

No breaking UI changes outside the task scope.

If backend routes/mounts are touched, prove parity in BOTH src/index.ts and src/server.ts.

REPO + RELEASE GUARDRAILS (MANDATORY):

Confirm repo is correct (open-invite-app).

Confirm branch name.

Confirm working tree clean before starting (or explicitly list existing changes).

Do not create or commit _HANDOFF.txt|md files.

Only update SSOT docs if required by the task (GOLDEN_FLOWS / UX_CONTRACTS / FINDINGS), and keep changes minimal.

TEXTSAFE DISCIPLINE:

Your final output MUST be plain text (no markdown tables, no fancy formatting).

If you provide commands, they must be copy-paste safe with no inline comments.

TASK INPUT FORMAT (PASTED BY USER):
GOLDEN FLOW BLOCK:
(paste a single issue formatted as:)

GOLDEN FLOW

CURRENT BEHAVIOR

ACCEPTANCE CHECKS (must include device requirement if applicable)

NON-GOALS

ASSETS (screenshots/logs)

WORK PLAN (YOU MUST FOLLOW):
A) Restate the Golden Flow in 1–2 lines.
B) Identify root cause with exact file + line range.
C) Implement minimal fix.
D) Blast-radius sweep:

List exact search queries you ran (rg terms) and what you found.

Fix any other matches if they violate the same contract OR justify exclusion.
E) Verification:

Provide explicit device steps to confirm acceptance checks.

If device-only, do not mark complete without those steps described clearly.

REQUIRED DEV PROOF:

Add or use existing DEV log tags ONLY when they prove the acceptance checks.

Logs must correspond to the actual flow (not generic “loaded ok”).

Remove noisy logs if they don’t prove outcome.

HANDOFF PACKET (MANDATORY, PLAIN TEXT, ONLY THIS TASK):
Include exactly:

SUMMARY

ROOT CAUSE (file + line range)

FIX (file + line range)

BLAST RADIUS SWEEP (search terms + results)

VERIFICATION STEPS (include device steps)

GIT PROOF (paste exact outputs):

git show --stat HEAD

git show --name-only HEAD
