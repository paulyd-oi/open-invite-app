HANDOFF PACKET — P1 EVENT DETAILS VISIBILITY ROW HOST-ONLY
====================================================================
Date: 2025-02-01
Branch: main
Repo: github.com/paulyd-oi/open-invite-app.git

SUMMARY
-------
Visibility row on Event Details screen is now hidden for non-host viewers.

- Host viewing their event: sees Visibility row (All Friends / Specific Groups)
- Non-host viewing event: Visibility row hidden
- No layout spacing issues (border-t inside conditional)

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/app/event/[id].tsx (MODIFIED)
   - Lines 1017-1058: Wrapped Visibility section in isMyEvent conditional

2. docs/FINDINGS_LOG.md (MODIFIED)
   - Added P1 Event Details Visibility Row entry

HOST IDENTIFICATION
-------------------
Variable: isMyEvent (line 471)
Logic: event?.userId === session?.user?.id
Pattern: Same as edit/delete button gating

KEY DIFF
--------
src/app/event/[id].tsx:

// Before (line 1017):
{/* Visibility */}
<View className="py-3 border-t" ...>

// After (lines 1017-1018):
{/* Visibility - Host only */}
{isMyEvent && (
<View className="py-3 border-t" ...>
  ...
</View>
)}

RUNTIME STATUS
--------------
npm run typecheck                    PASS
./scripts/ai/verify_frontend.sh      PASS

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
-------------------
[x] Non-host viewing event: no Visibility row
[x] Host viewing event: Visibility row still present
[x] Layout spacing clean (no extra divider lines)
[x] typecheck PASS
[x] verify_frontend.sh PASS

MANUAL TEST NOTES
-----------------
1. Create an event as User A
2. View event as User A → Visibility row visible
3. View same event as User B (friend) → Visibility row hidden
4. Check for orphan borders or spacing issues

CONSTRAINTS MET
---------------
- Minimal diff (+3 lines: comment, opening conditional, closing paren)
- No new dependencies
- Icons: unchanged
- Navigation architecture preserved
