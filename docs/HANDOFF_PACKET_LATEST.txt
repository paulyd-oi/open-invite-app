HANDOFF PACKET — Spacing and Divider Polish
============================================

SUMMARY
-------
Increased perceived quality by adding breathing room between major sections.
No new components, no navigation changes, no behavior changes.
Minimal diff — only padding/margin adjustments.

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/app/calendar.tsx
2. src/app/social.tsx
3. src/app/circles.tsx
4. docs/STATE_OF_THE_APP.md

WHAT VISUALLY CHANGED (per screen)
----------------------------------

Calendar (src/app/calendar.tsx):
- Selected Date Events section: mt-4 to mt-6, mb-3 to mb-4 (more breathing room after calendar grid)
- Event list date headers: mt-4 to mt-5, mb-2 to mb-3 (more space between date groups)

Social Feed (src/app/social.tsx):
- Page header: pt-2 pb-4 to pt-4 pb-5 (less crowded top area)
- Event sections: mb-4 to mb-6 (more separation between time groups)
- Section titles: mb-3 to mb-4 (breathing room before first card)

Circles (src/app/circles.tsx):
- Page header: pb-4 to pb-6 (more space before content area)

HOW TO SPOT CHECK (manual)
--------------------------
1. Open Calendar tab - verify more space between calendar and "Selected Date Events" title
2. Open Social tab - verify header doesn't feel cramped at top
3. Open Social tab - verify "Today", "Tomorrow", etc. sections have breathing room
4. Open Circles tab - verify header has comfortable spacing to first circle card

VERIFY RESULTS
--------------
npm run typecheck — PASS
bash scripts/ai/verify_frontend.sh — PASS

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------
- No double dividers found — existing patterns are clean
- Used only className spacing utilities (mt-X, mb-X, pt-X, pb-X)
- No new colors, shadows, or animations added
- Event detail (src/app/event/[id].tsx) already had good spacing — no changes needed
