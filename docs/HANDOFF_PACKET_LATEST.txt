HANDOFF PACKET — P1-C SUBSCRIPTION CLEANUP (NO TRIAL + SIMPLE PAYWALL)
====================================================================
Date: 2026-02-01
Branch: main
Repo: github.com/paulyd-oi/open-invite-app.git

SUMMARY
-------
Removed all free trial language and simplified subscription UI to
only promise what's actually enforced today:
- Free: Host up to 3 events per month
- Founder Pro: Unlimited hosting

Removed unenforced feature promises (circles, insights, analytics,
co-hosts, etc.) from comparison tables.

ROOT CAUSE
----------
1. UI mentioned "14-day free trial" when no trial is configured
2. Feature tables listed many aspirational features not enforced
3. Co-hosts was listed but had been removed from codebase

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/components/UpgradeModal.tsx
   - Removed "• 2-week free trial" from pricing info

2. src/app/subscription.tsx
   - Changed "14-day free trial" → "Unlimited hosting"
   - Changed CTA "Start Pro Trial" → "Subscribe Now"  
   - Simplified featureCategories: 4 groups → 1 group
   - Removed unused icon imports

3. src/app/paywall.tsx
   - Removed "Add co-hosts" from FREE_FEATURES
   - Removed "Unlimited co-hosts" from PREMIUM_FEATURES
   - Updated copy: "Host up to 3 events per month"

4. src/app/invite.tsx
   - Removed "They get 1 week free trial" from referral rewards

5. docs/FINDINGS_LOG.md
   - Added P1-C entry with root cause + fix notes

KEY DIFFS
---------
UpgradeModal.tsx:
- ${PRICING.proYearly}/year • 2-week free trial
+ ${PRICING.proYearly}/year

subscription.tsx:
- {PRICING.trialDays}-day free trial
+ Unlimited hosting

- return "Start Pro Trial";
+ return "Subscribe Now";

paywall.tsx:
- { text: "Add co-hosts", included: false },
+ (removed)

- { text: "Unlimited co-hosts", included: true },
+ (removed)

./scripts/ai/verify_frontend.sh      PASS
