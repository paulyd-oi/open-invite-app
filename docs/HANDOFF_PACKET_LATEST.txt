HANDOFF PACKET — UX Polish: Birthday Navigation + Dark Header + Bio + 14-Day Count
==================================================================================

SUMMARY
-------
Four UX improvements from TestFlight inventory:
1. Birthday cards in calendar now navigate to User Profile on tap
2. Friend Profile header text visible in dark mode (headerTintColor/headerTitleStyle)
3. Friend Profile shows bio field when present (in addition to calendarBio)
4. Social feed count changed from "X plans happening soon" to "X plans in next 14 days"

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/app/calendar.tsx — Birthday card tap navigation to /user/[id]
2. src/app/friend/[id].tsx — Dark mode header + bio display
3. src/app/social.tsx — 14-day plans count filter
4. docs/STATE_OF_THE_APP.md — Updated session fixes

WHAT CHANGED (per file)
-----------------------

calendar.tsx:
- UpcomingBirthdaysSection: Added useRouter hook
- Birthday cards: Changed from View to Pressable
- Tap handler: Navigates to /user/{friendId} (not own birthday)
- Visual affordance: ChevronRight added for navigable items

friend/[id].tsx:
- Stack.Screen options: Added headerTintColor={colors.text}
- Stack.Screen options: Added headerTitleStyle={{ color: colors.text }}
- Profile card: Added {friend.Profile?.bio} display after handle, before calendarBio section

social.tsx:
- New memo: plansIn14Days — filters allEvents to next 14 days
- Micro Social Proof Line: Changed from allEvents.length to plansIn14Days
- Copy changed: "X plans happening soon" → "X plans in the next 14 days"

HOW TO VERIFY
-------------
1. Calendar → Upcoming Birthdays section → Tap friend's birthday → Should open User Profile
2. Friends → Tap friend → Friend Profile → Toggle to dark mode → Header title should be visible
3. Friend Profile → If friend has bio set, should display above "My calendar looks like..."
4. Social tab → See "X plans in the next 14 days" (only counts events within 14 days)

VERIFY RESULTS
--------------
npm run typecheck — PASS
No TypeScript errors in modified files

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------
- Birthday cards navigate to /user/[id] (User Profile) not /friend/[id] (Friend Profile)
  because the birthday API returns userId, not friendshipId. User Profile supports
  friend request functionality if not yet friends.
- Own birthday ("My Birthday") is not tappable (disabled)
- 14-day filter uses Date math: now + 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000

NEXT STEPS
----------
- Consider adding friendshipId to /api/birthdays response for direct Friend Profile navigation
- TestFlight validation of all 4 fixes
- Used only className spacing utilities (mt-X, mb-X, pt-X, pb-X)
- No new colors, shadows, or animations added
- Event detail (src/app/event/[id].tsx) already had good spacing — no changes needed
