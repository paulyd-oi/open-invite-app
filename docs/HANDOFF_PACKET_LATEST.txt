CIRCLES FILTER PILL FIX - HANDOFF PACKET
======================================================

SUMMARY
-------
Fixed Circles filter pill to be disabled instead of causing empty feed.

STATUS: COMPLETE
VERIFICATION: PENDING

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/app/social.tsx
   - Added safeToast import
   - Circles filter pill now has 0.5 opacity (disabled styling)
   - Tapping Circles shows toast: "Coming soon" / "Circles filtering is coming soon."
   - Uses Haptics.notificationAsync(Warning) for disabled state feedback
   - Does NOT switch filters when tapped

2. docs/STATE_OF_THE_APP.md
   - Added Circles filter fix to "Fixed This Session"
   - Updated "Last Verified" timestamp

3. docs/HANDOFF_PACKET_LATEST.txt
   - Updated with current handoff

KEY DIFFS
---------
IMPORT ADDED:
  import { safeToast } from "@/lib/safeToast";

FILTER PILL LOGIC:
  const isDisabled = filter === 'circles';
  
  onPress={() => {
    if (isDisabled) {
      Haptics.notificationAsync(Haptics.NotificationFeedbackType.Warning);
      safeToast.info("Coming soon", "Circles filtering is coming soon.");
      return;
    }
    Haptics.selectionAsync();
    setActiveFilter(filter);
  }}
  
  style={{
    ...existing styles,
    opacity: isDisabled ? 0.5 : 1,
  }}

TEST PLAN
---------
1. Tap Circles filter pill - verify toast appears
2. Verify feed does NOT empty (stays on previous filter)
3. Verify other filter pills still work normally
4. Verify Circles pill has reduced opacity

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------
1. Circles filter is coming soon (needs backend support)
2. Pill remains visible but disabled
