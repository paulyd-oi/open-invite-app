SOCIAL FEED BROWSING IMPROVEMENTS - HANDOFF PACKET
======================================================

SUMMARY
-------
Added filter pills (All/Friends/Circles/Hosting/Going) and collapsible time sections to Social feed.

STATUS: COMPLETE
VERIFICATION: PASSED

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/app/social.tsx
   - Added FilterType type and filter state management
   - Added collapsible sections state (Set<string>)
   - Added filter pills UI (horizontal scroll, 5 options)
   - Added filtering logic after series grouping (client-side only)
   - Updated EventSection for collapsible behavior with count display
   - Updated all EventSection calls with collapse props

2. docs/STATE_OF_THE_APP.md
   - Added filter pills to "Fixed This Session"
   - Added collapsible sections to "Fixed This Session"
   - Updated "Last Verified" to 2026-01-26

KEY DIFFS
---------
FILTER STATE:
  type FilterType = "all" | "friends" | "circles" | "hosting" | "going";
  const [activeFilter, setActiveFilter] = useState<FilterType>("all");
  const [collapsedSections, setCollapsedSections] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

FILTER LOGIC:
  - All: Show all events
  - Friends: event.userId in friendsData.friends (uses friendId)
  - Hosting: event.userId === session.user.id
  - Going: event.id in attendingData.events
  - Circles: Placeholder (returns false)

COLLAPSIBLE SECTIONS:
  - Header shows "Title (count)" and arrow (▼/▶)
  - Tap toggles collapse state
  - All sections expanded by default
  - Events hidden when collapsed

TEST PLAN
---------
1. Tap each filter pill - verify events filter correctly
2. Tap section headers - verify collapse/expand behavior
3. Verify filters work with recurring series grouping
4. Verify collapse state persists during filter changes

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------
1. Circles filter is placeholder only
2. Filter/collapse state resets on unmount
3. No accessibility labels yet

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------
1. AsyncStorage persistence for filter/collapse state
2. Circles filter implementation (needs backend support)
3. Filter badges with counts
4. Accessibility improvements
