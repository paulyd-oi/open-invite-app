HANDOFF PACKET — WELCOME SCREEN ANIMATION FIX
====================================================================
Date: 2026-02-01
Branch: main
Repo: github.com/paulyd-oi/open-invite-app.git

SUMMARY
-------
Fixed Welcome screen animation "bounce then snap" issue by configuring
FadeInUp springs with higher damping to prevent overshoot.

ROOT CAUSE
----------
Default FadeInUp.springify() uses low damping which causes:
1. Spring overshoots final position (bounce)
2. Animation clips/snaps when settling, especially on slower devices
3. Combined with SlideInRight/SlideOutLeft transitions, timing conflicts

SOLUTION
--------
Created smoothFadeIn() helper that applies:
- damping(20): High damping prevents overshoot
- stiffness(90): Moderate stiffness for smooth motion
- No more "bounce then teleport to final position"

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/app/welcome.tsx
   - Added smoothFadeIn() helper function after imports
   - Replaced all 12 FadeInUp.springify() calls with smoothFadeIn()

KEY DIFFS
---------
+// ============ ANIMATION HELPERS ============
+// Configure FadeInUp with high damping to prevent overshoot/snap
+// Default springify() can cause "bounce then snap" on some devices
+const smoothFadeIn = (delayMs = 0) =>
+  FadeInUp.delay(delayMs).springify().damping(20).stiffness(90);

All Animated.View entering= props changed from:
  FadeInUp.delay(X).springify()
To:
  smoothFadeIn(X)

RUNTIME STATUS
--------------
npm run typecheck                    PASS
./scripts/ai/verify_frontend.sh      PASS

WHY THIS WORKS
--------------
- damping(20) prevents spring overshoot (default is ~10-15)
- stiffness(90) maintains responsiveness without being too stiff
- Animation ends at exact final position without "snap"
- All motion is transform-based (translateY, opacity) - no layout props
- No setState during animation window

TEST PLAN
---------
1. Launch app on iOS simulator/device
2. Go through all 4 welcome slides:
   - Slide 1: "Your Social Calendar" with icon/buttons
   - Slide 2: Create Account form
   - Slide 3: Set Up Profile form
   - Slide 4: Quote card
3. Verify smooth fade-in animation on each slide
4. No "bounce then snap" at end of animation
5. Slide transitions (swipe between slides) smooth
6. Email login flow still works end-to-end

CONSTRAINTS MET
---------------
- Minimal diff (1 file, +19/-12 lines)
- No new dependencies
- Reanimated already configured in repo
- Navigation architecture unchanged
- Icon system untouched
- Only transform + opacity animations (no layout props)
