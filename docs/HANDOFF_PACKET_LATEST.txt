RUTHLESS SIMPLICITY PHASE 1 - HANDOFF PACKET
======================================================

SUMMARY
-------
UI subtraction to reduce cognitive load and improve UX clarity.

Changes:
1. Social feed: Removed "Weekly" pill from recurring event cards
2. RSVP states: Removed "Maybe" option, mapping to "Interested" if backend returns it
3. Circle Create Event: Simplified by removing Event Mode, Frequency, Send Notification toggles
4. Bottom nav: Reordered to Discover | Calendar | Social (CENTER) | Friends | Profile
5. Default landing: Social feed on authenticated boot instead of Calendar
6. CTA copy: "Create Open Invite" → "Create Invite"

KEY DIFFS
---------
# social.tsx EventCard - removed Weekly pill
-              {isSeries && (...Weekly pill...)}
-              {isOwn && !isSeries && (...You badge...)}
+              {isOwn && (...You badge...)}

# event/[id].tsx - removed Maybe button, map to Interested
-  {(myRsvpStatus === "interested" || myRsvpStatus === "maybe") && ...}

# create.tsx - conditional rendering for circle events
+  {!isCircleEvent && (<Frequency section/>)}
+  {!isCircleEvent && (<Send Notification section/>)}

# navigation.ts - reordered tabs with Social centered
-  { key: "social", ... isCenter: false },
-  { key: "home", ... isCenter: true },
+  { key: "calendar", ... isCenter: false },
+  { key: "social", ... isCenter: true },

TEST PLAN
---------
1. Cold launch → should land on /social (not /calendar)
2. Bottom nav order: Discover | Calendar | Social(elevated) | Friends | Profile
3. Social feed event cards: No "Weekly" pill, "You" badge still shows for own events
4. Event detail RSVP: Options are Going | Interested | Can't Make It (no Maybe)
5. Create event from Circle: Only shows Title, Date/Time, Location, Create Invite button
   - No Event Mode toggle
   - No Frequency picker
   - No Send Notification toggle
6. Create event (non-circle): Full UI with Frequency and Notification toggles
7. CTA button reads "Create Invite" (not "Create Open Invite")
8. If backend returns "maybe" RSVP status, display shows "Interested"

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------
1. Backend may still store "maybe" status - mapped to "interested" display only
2. Circle events always send notifications implicitly (removed toggle)
