HANDOFF PACKET — Error Message UX Humanization
===============================================

SUMMARY
-------
Replaced harsh, developer-style error messages with calm, human-friendly microcopy.
No raw error codes (401/500), no "Something went wrong", no error.message leaks.
Text-only changes — no new components, no new error handling architecture.

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/app/calendar.tsx
2. src/app/event/[id].tsx
3. src/app/event/edit/[id].tsx
4. src/app/event-request/[id].tsx
5. src/app/import-calendar.tsx
6. docs/STATE_OF_THE_APP.md

HOW TO TEST (manual error scenarios)
------------------------------------
1. Airplane mode test: Enable airplane mode, try to RSVP to an event → should see "Oops / That didn't go through. Please try again."
2. Network error on calendar: Kill backend, go to calendar tab → should see "Couldn't load your calendar / Couldn't refresh right now. Try again in a moment."
3. Comment post failure: Try posting comment with network off → should see "Oops / That didn't go through. Please try again."
4. Calendar sync failure: Try syncing event to device calendar with network off → should see "Sync Failed / That didn't go through. Please try again."

STANDARDS APPLIED
-----------------
- Network / refresh failure: "Couldn't refresh right now. Try again in a moment."
- Action failed (generic): "That didn't go through. Please try again."
- No raw server errors exposed to users
- No harsh "Error" titles — replaced with "Oops" or contextual titles
