=== GATE 2: businessEvents ===
PASS: rg returns zero matches

=== GATE 3: isBusinessEvent ===

Any ripgrep match for the pattern indicates a regression

- Briefcase icon still available for work-related UI (separate from business branding)
- Personal profile system fully intact
- Circles system untouched
