HANDOFF PACKET — WELCOME ANIMATION OVERSHOOT FIX
====================================================================
Date: 2026-02-01
Branch: main
Repo: github.com/paulyd-oi/open-invite-app.git

SUMMARY
-------
Removed "swings down then swings up" animation artifact on Welcome
screen load by replacing spring-based animation with duration-based.

ROOT CAUSE
----------
FadeInUp.springify().damping(20).stiffness(90) still allowed spring
overshoot on translateY, causing visible swing/rebound on load.

FIX
---
Replaced springify() chain with duration-based entrance animation:

FROM:
  FadeInUp.delay(delayMs).springify().damping(20).stiffness(90)

TO:
  FadeInUp.delay(delayMs).duration(280)

Duration-based animation cannot overshoot - it interpolates linearly
from start to end position over 280ms.

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/app/welcome.tsx
   - smoothFadeIn helper: 1 line change

KEY DIFF
--------
-// Configure FadeInUp with high damping to prevent overshoot/snap
-// Default springify() can cause "bounce then snap" on some devices
-const smoothFadeIn = (delayMs = 0) =>
-  FadeInUp.delay(delayMs).springify().damping(20).stiffness(90);

+// Duration-based entrance animation - no spring overshoot possible
+const smoothFadeIn = (delayMs = 0) =>
+  FadeInUp.delay(delayMs).duration(280);

RUNTIME STATUS
--------------
npm run typecheck                    PASS
./scripts/ai/verify_frontend.sh      PASS

iOS TEST NOTE
-------------
On iOS simulator/device:
- Welcome slides should fade in smoothly from below
- No visible swing down then swing up
- No bounce/rebound at end of animation
- 280ms duration feels responsive but not abrupt

CONSTRAINTS MET
---------------
- Minimal diff (1 file, 3 lines changed)
- No new dependencies
- No usage sites changed
- Navigation architecture unchanged
