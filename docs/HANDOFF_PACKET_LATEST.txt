HANDOFF PACKET — P1-B FOUNDER BADGE VISIBILITY
====================================================================
Date: 2025-02-01
Branch: main
Repo: github.com/paulyd-oi/open-invite-app.git

SUMMARY
-------
Founder badge is now hidden from users who cannot earn it.

- If user does NOT have Founder badge unlocked → badge is NOT shown in Locked section
- If user DOES have Founder badge unlocked → shows normally in Unlocked section
- No "locked state" UI introduced (badge simply omitted)
- @paul (founder account) still sees it (earned)

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/app/achievements.tsx (MODIFIED)
   - Line 114: Added filter to exclude "founder" from lockedBadges

2. docs/FINDINGS_LOG.md (MODIFIED)
   - Added P1-B entry with root cause + fix notes

BADGE IDENTIFIER
----------------
Key: "founder" (badgeKey field, case-sensitive)
Match type: Exact string equality check

KEY DIFF
--------
src/app/achievements.tsx:

// Before (line 114):
const lockedBadges = badges.filter((b) => !b.unlocked);

// After (line 114-115):
// Hide Founder badge from locked section (not earnable by regular users)
const lockedBadges = badges.filter((b) => !b.unlocked && b.badgeKey !== "founder");
