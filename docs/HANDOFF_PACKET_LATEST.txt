HANDOFF PACKET: Event Detail "More" Bottom Sheet (V1 UX)
=========================================================
Date: 2026-02-02
Branch: main
Repo: github.com/paulyd-oi/open-invite-app.git

SUMMARY
-------
Replaced multiple headerRight icon buttons (Edit, Duplicate, Share, Report) in
the Event Detail screen with a single "More" ellipsis button that opens a
context-aware bottom sheet modal.

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/ui/icons.tsx
   - Added: MoreHorizontal icon (ellipsis-horizontal)

2. src/app/event/[id].tsx
   - Added: MoreHorizontal to icon imports
   - Added: showEventActionsSheet state
   - Replaced: headerRight from 4 buttons to single MoreHorizontal button
   - Added: Event Actions Bottom Sheet Modal with context-aware actions

BEHAVIOR
--------
Header:
- Single "..." (MoreHorizontal) icon in top-right
- Tapping opens bottom sheet with haptic feedback

Bottom Sheet (Owner - isMyEvent === true):
- Edit Event -> navigates to /event/edit/${id}
- Duplicate Event -> calls handleDuplicateEvent
- Share Event -> calls shareEvent(event)
- Cancel -> closes sheet

Bottom Sheet (Non-Owner - isMyEvent === false, not busy):
- Share Event -> calls shareEvent(event)
- Report Event -> opens Report Modal
- Cancel -> closes sheet

Busy blocks only show Cancel (no actions exposed).

UI DETAILS
----------
- Sheet slides up with FadeInDown animation
- Rounded top corners (24px radius)
- Drag handle at top
- "Event Options" title
- Each action row has icon in circle + label
- Cancel button centered at bottom

TESTS RUN
---------
- npm run typecheck: PASS
- bash scripts/ai/verify_frontend.sh: PASS

HOW TO VERIFY
-------------
1. Open any event you own
   - Tap "..." in header
   - See: Edit Event, Duplicate Event, Share Event, Cancel

2. Open an event you don't own
   - Tap "..." in header
   - See: Share Event, Report Event, Cancel

3. Tap overlay or Cancel to close sheet

COMMIT
------
33ee8e0 fix(event): move header actions into more sheet
