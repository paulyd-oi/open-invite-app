HANDOFF PACKET: P0 SUGGESTIONS BIO ON PEOPLE CARDS
==================================================
Date: 2026-02-03
Commit: f602384 (fix(p0): show bio on people suggestion cards)
Branch: main
Status: COMPLETE

SUMMARY
-------
Suggestions → People tab cards did not display user bios (e.g., carlifornia16 had a bio
on their profile but it wasn't shown on the suggestion card).

ROOT CAUSE
----------
The publicUserSchema in shared/contracts.ts did not include bio or calendarBio fields.
The code in suggestions.tsx used "as any" type cast to access these fields, but without
the schema including them, the types weren't propagated properly.

   - Added calendarBio: z.string().nullable().optional() to publicUserSchema

2. src/app/suggestions.tsx:
   - Removed "as any" type cast for bio access
   - Added [P0_SUGGESTIONS_BIO] DEV log for debugging
