SUMMARY
-------
- Gated 3 dev/debug screens behind __DEV__ to prevent production access
- Verified email usage patterns are safe with backend privacy fix (email=null)
- All verification scripts pass, no runtime crash risk

DEV/DEBUG SCREENS FOUND + HOW GATED
-----------------------------------
1. src/app/dev-smoke-tests.tsx - __DEV__ guard added
2. src/app/design-showcase.tsx - __DEV__ guard added  
3. src/app/debug/health.tsx - __DEV__ guard added

EMAIL ANALYSIS: All patterns use optional chaining - no changes needed.

PROOF: npm run typecheck PASS | verify_frontend.sh PASS
