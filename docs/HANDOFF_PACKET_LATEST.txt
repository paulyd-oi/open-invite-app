PHASE E.3 - CALENDAR IMPORT HELP SCREEN (TRUTHFUL + MOM-SAFE)
==============================================================

SUMMARY
-------
Rewrote /calendar-import-help screen with truthful, mom-safe content explaining one-time import behavior, sync limitations, and privacy.

Changes:
1. Title: "Calendar Import (How it works)"
2. Section 1: "One-time Import" - explains events are copied, not synced
3. Section 2: "Not a Live Sync (Yet)" - sets expectations
4. Section 3: "Privacy" - what friends see vs. what stays private
5. Bottom buttons: "Import Calendar" + "Back"
6. Tip: Private events still block time for scheduling

STATUS: COMPLETE
VERIFICATION: PASS

FILES CHANGED
-------------
1. src/app/calendar-import-help.tsx (complete rewrite)
   - New icon imports: Download, RefreshCw, Eye, Lock, Calendar
   - 3 content sections with clear explanations
   - Fixed bottom button bar with Import + Back
   - ScrollView with proper bottom padding for buttons

2. docs/STATE_OF_THE_APP.md
   - Added E.3 stable item + Fixed This Session section

KEY CONTENT
-----------
## One-time Import
- Events are COPIED from device calendar into Open Invite
- Changes in calendar app won't update Open Invite (and vice versa)

## Not a Live Sync (Yet)
- No continuous calendar reading
- Import is one-time action per event
- Live two-way sync may come in future

## Privacy
- Friends see: Title, time, location (based on visibility choice)
- Always private: Notes, attendees, private calendar details

## Tip
- Mark events as "Private" to hide from friends but still block time

BUTTONS
-------
- Primary: "Import Calendar" → router.back() (returns to import flow)
- Secondary: "Back" → router.back()

TEST PLAN
---------
1. Navigate to /import-calendar
2. Tap "Learn More" link
3. Verify help screen opens with 3 sections
4. Verify "Import Calendar" button returns to import-calendar
5. Verify "Back" button works
6. Verify content is readable (no wall of text)
