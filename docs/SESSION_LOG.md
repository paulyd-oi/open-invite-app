# Session Log — iOS Build Failure Forensic Audit

## 2026-04-04 — Forensic audit session

### Files read
- `936ff97:package.json` — build 266 dependencies (sentry ~6.14.0, lottie-react-native 7.2.2)
- `936ff97:eas.json` — build 266 production config (no image pin, no hooks, no AVIF env)
- `936ff97:ios/Podfile` — build 266 Podfile (no AVIF env, no wholemodule hack)
- `936ff97:ios/Podfile.lock` — build 266 pod graph (lottie-ios 4.5.0, Sentry 8.50.2, SDWebImageAVIFCoder 0.11.1)
- `936ff97:app.json` — build 266 config (@sentry/react-native in plugins)
- `936ff97:ios/OpenInvite.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — build 266 pbxproj (5 Sentry refs)
- `HEAD:package.json` — lottie-react-native 7.3.6, no sentry
- `HEAD:eas.json` — EXPO_IMAGE_NO_AVIF=1, no image pin
- `HEAD:ios/Podfile` — AVIF env + wholemodule lottie hack
- `HEAD:ios/Podfile.lock` — lottie-ios 4.6.0, no Sentry, no AVIF
- `HEAD:scripts/eas-build-post-install.sh` — AVIF podspec+Swift patching
- `HEAD:ios/OpenInvite.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — 0 Sentry refs
- `.gitignore` — ios/Pods/, ios/OpenInvite.xcworkspace/ gitignored
- `package-lock.json` — lottie-react-native locked to 7.3.6

### Files changed
- `docs/FORENSICS_CACHE.md` — created (investigation scratchpad)
- `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` — created (this file)

### Root causes discovered
1. **Three simultaneous pod graph changes** between build 266 and HEAD: Sentry removal,
   Lottie upgrade, AVIF removal. Each changes the CocoaPods dependency graph.
2. **Build 266 had no EAS hooks, no AVIF exclusion, no Xcode image pin.** It compiled
   lottie-ios 4.5.0 + Sentry 8.50.2 + SDWebImageAVIFCoder successfully on whatever
   EAS default image was current on March 27.
3. **The EAS default image likely rotated** between March 27 and subsequent builds,
   which broke Sentry (SentryDefines.h not found on newer Xcode) and possibly lottie-ios.
4. **The Podfile.lock is committed but may be overridden** if EAS runs `expo prebuild`
   which regenerates native config before pod install.

### Key decisions
- Sentry removal is clean and complete
- lottie-react-native pinned to exact 7.3.6
- wholemodule hack in Podfile post_install is the right location
- AVIF patching in eas-build-post-install.sh is correct approach

### Unfinished work
- Need to verify whether EAS actually runs `expo prebuild` for this project
- Need to verify the wholemodule hack actually resolves lottie-ios 4.6.0 compile on Xcode 16.4
- Haven't yet tested a build — need one more build attempt
- Option C (revert to build 266 exact state + remove Sentry only) not yet evaluated
