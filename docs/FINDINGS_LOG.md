### Date: 2026-01-24
### Finding: React Native fetch silently drops uppercase 'Cookie' header
### Proof: 
- Better Auth expo client source (node_modules/@better-auth/expo/dist/client.mjs) shows:
  - Uses lowercase 'cookie' header
  - Sets credentials: 'omit' (not 'include')
  - Adds 'expo-origin' and 'x-skip-oauth-proxy' headers
  - Cookie format: "; name=value" (leading semicolon-space)
- curl with same cookie value worked (200) while app got 401
### Impact: All authenticated requests failed with 401 despite cookie being cached correctly
### Action Taken:
- Changed header from 'Cookie' to 'cookie' (lowercase)
- Changed credentials from 'include' to 'omit'
- Added expo-origin and x-skip-oauth-proxy headers
- Cookie format now matches Better Auth expo: "; name=value"
## 2026-01-24

### Finding: React Native fetch drops uppercase `Cookie` headers — Better Auth cookies must be sent using lowercase `cookie`.

### Proof:
- SecureStore contained valid `__Secure-better-auth.session_token`
- Header was being set as `Cookie:` but backend always returned 401
- Switching to lowercase `cookie:` immediately allowed `/api/auth/session` to return 200

### Impact:
All manual cookie forwarding in Expo/React Native must follow Better Auth expo client’s exact header pattern:
- lowercase `cookie`
- `credentials: "omit"`
- include `expo-origin` + `x-skip-oauth-proxy`

### Action Taken:
Updated authClient request layer to match Better Auth expo transport behavior exactly.

### Date: 2026-01-24
### Finding: Email signup in welcome.tsx bypassed cookie establishment
### Proof:
- welcome.tsx handleEmailAuth() used raw authClient.$fetch('/api/auth/sign-up/email')
- This bypassed captureAndStoreCookie(), refreshExplicitCookie(), verifySessionAfterAuth()
- authClient.signUp.email() method already has all this logic built in
- Signup returned 200 but next /api/auth/session returned 401 due to no cookie in SecureStore
### Impact: New account signup never established cookie session, onboarding bounced to login
### Action Taken:
- Changed welcome.tsx to use authClient.signUp.email() and authClient.signIn.email()
- Added session verification check before advancing to next onboarding step
- Error now shown to user if session fails (no auto-redirect to login)

### Date: 2026-01-24
### Finding: Authed queries firing during logout/loading cause 401 storm
### Proof:
- Queries in profile.tsx, settings.tsx, friends.tsx used `enabled: !!session`
- After logout, cached session still exists momentarily
- Queries fire with stale session while bootStatus is 'loading' or 'loggedOut'
- Backend returns 401 for each → 401 spam in logs
### Impact: Race conditions during logout/login transitions, poor UX, confusing logs
### Action Taken:
- Changed all authed queries to use `enabled: bootStatus === 'authed'`
- Files fixed: calendar.tsx, profile.tsx, settings.tsx, friends.tsx

---

### Date: 2026-01-24
### Finding: /uploads/ images blocked by legacy bearer token check
### Proof:
- imageSource.ts logged: "Protected URL requires token but none available: .../uploads/...jpg"
- Backend actually serves /uploads/ paths as 200 without authentication
- Frontend was unnecessarily blocking image render
### Impact: Avatar images failed to render after logout or when no token cached
### Action Taken:
- Modified requiresAuth() in imageSource.ts to return false for /uploads/ paths
- /uploads/ URLs now treated as public, rendered without Authorization header

---

### Date: 2026-01-24
### Finding: useEntitlements hook needs enabled gating to prevent 401 during logout/loading
### Proof:
- Hook called useQuery without `enabled` gating on bootStatus
- During logout, fetch fires while session is invalid → 401 error
### Impact: Spurious 401 errors in console, confusing debug output
### Action Taken:
- Added optional `{ enabled?: boolean }` parameter to useEntitlements hook
- Preserves placeholderData behavior so entitlements always have a value

---

### Date: 2026-01-24
### Finding: MiniCalendar gated on !!session instead of bootStatus === 'authed'
### Proof:
- MiniCalendar component used `enabled: !!session && !!friendshipId`
- After logout, session may still be in React Query cache momentarily
- Caused calendar data fetches to fire during logout transition
### Impact: Same 401 race condition as other queries
### Action Taken:
- Changed MiniCalendar to accept `bootStatus: string` prop
- Changed enabled to `bootStatus === 'authed' && !!friendshipId`
- Updated FriendCard and FriendListItem to pass bootStatus prop

---

### Date: 2026-01-24
### Finding: Logout key deletion had scattered logs, no audit trail
### Proof:
- Multiple console.log statements during logout
- No consolidated list of which keys were deleted/failed
- Difficult to verify clean logout in production logs
### Impact: Debugging account switch issues required reading many log lines
### Action Taken:
- Added SECURESTORE_AUTH_KEYS and ASYNCSTORAGE_AUTH_KEYS arrays
- Track deletion success/failure per key
- Emit single [LOGOUT_INVARIANT] JSON log with keysDeleted, keysFailed, verifyCleared, verifyRemaining, success
