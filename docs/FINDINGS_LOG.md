### Finding: React Native fetch silently drops uppercase 'Cookie' header
### Proof: 
- Better Auth expo client source (node_modules/@better-auth/expo/dist/client.mjs) shows:
  - Uses lowercase 'cookie' header
  - Sets credentials: 'omit' (not 'include')
  - Adds 'expo-origin' and 'x-skip-oauth-proxy' headers
  - Cookie format: "; name=value" (leading semicolon-space)
- curl with same cookie value worked (200) while app got 401
### Impact: All authenticated requests failed with 401 despite cookie being cached correctly
### Action Taken:
- Changed header from 'Cookie' to 'cookie' (lowercase)
- Changed credentials from 'include' to 'omit'
- Added expo-origin and x-skip-oauth-proxy headers
- Cookie format now matches Better Auth expo: "; name=value"
