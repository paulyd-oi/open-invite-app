Session: Phase 1C — Remove Social feed filters (ruthless simplicity)
Commit: fe873d1

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE — Filter pills removed, pure discovery feed restored

================================================================================
WHAT WAS DONE
================================================================================

PHASE 1C OBJECTIVE: Remove Social feed filter UI to reduce cognitive load and restore pure discovery experience

CODE CLEANUP (src/app/social.tsx):
✅ Line 406: Removed FilterType type definition ("all" | "friends" | "circles" | "hosting" | "going")
✅ Line 423: Removed activeFilter state (useState<FilterType>("all"))
✅ Lines 793-822: Removed filteredGroupedEvents useMemo logic with filter application
✅ Lines 960-1000: Removed filter pills UI (horizontal ScrollView with pill buttons)
✅ Lines 897-899: Updated hasEvents check to use groupedEvents instead of filteredGroupedEvents
✅ Lines 1104-1157: Updated all EventSection calls to use groupedEvents instead of filteredGroupedEvents

PRESERVED FEATURES:
✅ Collapsible sections (Today/Tomorrow/This Week/Upcoming) — retained for scannable structure
✅ collapsedSections state and toggleSection function — still functional
✅ friendsData and attendingData queries — still used for socialMemory and first-value nudge
✅ Section count display in headers — "(3)" badge shows event count per section

DOCUMENTATION:
✅ docs/STATE_OF_THE_APP.md
   - Added Phase 1C section: "Social feed filters: Removed All/Friends/Circles/Hosting/Going filter pills"
   - Updated Stable section: "Social feed: Pure discovery (no filter pills, shows all events)"
   - Moved collapsible sections bullet to Previously Fixed (feature retained)
   - Removed contradictory "Social feed filter pills: Added..." entry from Previously Fixed

✅ docs/FINDINGS_LOG.md
   - Added "Ruthless Simplicity Pattern (Canonical)" section
   - Documents Phase 1C change, principle, and impact
   - Establishes pattern for future simplification decisions

VERIFICATION:
✅ npm run typecheck → PASS
✅ scripts/ai/verify_frontend.sh → PASS (all invariants satisfied)
✅ rg -n "activeFilter|setActiveFilter|FilterType" src/app/social.tsx → No matches (fully removed)

FILES MODIFIED
================================================================================

src/app/social.tsx           - Removed FilterType, activeFilter, filteredGroupedEvents, filter pills UI
docs/STATE_OF_THE_APP.md     - Added Phase 1C section, updated Stable section
docs/FINDINGS_LOG.md         - Added Ruthless Simplicity Pattern canonical section

================================================================================
TECHNICAL NOTES
================================================================================

MINIMAL DIFF ACHIEVED:
- Only removed filter-related code (type, state, pills UI, filter logic)
- No refactoring of unrelated feed architecture
- Collapsible sections feature untouched (user value retained)
- Query structure unchanged (friendsData/attendingData still fetched for other features)

QUERIES STILL IN USE:
- friendsData: Used for socialMemory pattern detection, first-value nudge eligibility
- attendingData: Used for socialMemory pattern detection, first-value nudge eligibility
- myEventsData: Used for socialMemory pattern detection, feed merge with feed events
- All queries remain necessary for existing features despite filter removal

UI BEHAVIOR AFTER REMOVAL:
- Social feed shows ALL events from feed + myEvents (no client-side filtering)
- Events grouped into Today/Tomorrow/This Week/Upcoming sections
- Each section collapsible/expandable with count badge
- Pure discovery: user sees full event landscape without artificial filtering

COGNITIVE LOAD REDUCTION:
- Before: 5 filter pills (All/Friends/Circles/Hosting/Going) + active state visual feedback
- After: Clean header with title + quick event button only
- Simpler mental model: "This is everything happening" vs "Which filter am I using?"

CODE REMOVED SUMMARY:
- 1 type definition (FilterType)
- 1 state variable (activeFilter)
- 1 derived state computation (filteredGroupedEvents useMemo with 30-line filter logic)
- 1 UI component block (filter pills horizontal ScrollView, ~40 lines JSX)
- ~80 lines total removed for minimal diff

NEXT SESSION GUIDANCE
================================================================================

PHASE 1C COMPLETE:
✅ Filter pills removed from Social feed
✅ Pure discovery experience restored
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Typecheck passing
✅ All invariants satisfied

READY FOR COMMIT:
- Message: "fix(ux): remove social feed filters (ruthless simplicity)"
- Clean removal with minimal diff
- No breaking changes or regressions

IF ISSUES ARISE:
- Social feed shows all events (expected behavior)
- No filter UI visible (expected after removal)
- Collapsible sections still work (intentionally retained)
- friendsData/attendingData queries still run (used by socialMemory, first-value nudge)

PATTERN ESTABLISHED:
- "Ruthless Simplicity" documented in FINDINGS_LOG.md
- Principle: Remove features that add complexity without proportional user value
- Future candidates: Any UI that creates cognitive load without clear benefit

================================================================================
END HANDOFF
